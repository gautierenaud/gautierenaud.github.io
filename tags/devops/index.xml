I&amp;rsquo;m more of a Dev than an Ops, so I wanted some time/playground to learn a bit more about the concepts that are dealt with on the Ops side.
The idea would be to learn about (thrown in random order, not exhaustive nor contractual):
observability traceability idempotency/replayability chaos engineering logs sidecars profiling security repo structure monorepo by component split deployment In order to learn all those different topics, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to create a dummy project with a simple architecture (some services, a bit of Pub/Sub buses and a database) and enhancing it bit by bit with the different concepts as I learn about them.</description></item></channel></rss>
